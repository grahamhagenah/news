"""Open a GitHub issue for each feed that has been failing for a while, and close it once it loads again.

Runs on GitHub after each build (see .github/workflows/deploy.yml), reading the failures the build recorded
in the JSON it publishes: python3 alerts.py dist/feeds.json. GitHub emails the repo's owner about new
issues, so a feed that breaks for good doesn't go unnoticed. A short hiccup doesn't count: a feed must fail
every build for ALERT_AFTER first. (The same script runs for events.grahamhagenah.com.)
